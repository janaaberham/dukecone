## TODO list:
- Test nodes + rates - make sure all the rates make sense!
- Mocap location/coordinate correctness + tests [SmellyNav]
- Bearing ground truth vs bearing measurements test[SMelly]
- More EKF + measurement test
  - Make sure exp1 is correct before moving on.
- Experiment 2. Running EKF with angled object [SmellyNav]
- Print large puppy picture for the cones [SMelly]
- Going around square/circle experiments [SMelly?]
- Controller [SmellyNav]
