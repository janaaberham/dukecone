EKF-Localization with object detection using CNNs


## TODO list:
- Object location/coordinate -> mf [SmellyNav]
- Calculating bearing given the image, bounding box and kinect fov? [SMelly]
- Fixing the Ht matrix, swapped bearing and range?
  - Make sure exp1 is correct before moving on.
- Experiment 2. Running EKF with angled object [SmellyNav?]
- Print large puppy picture for the cones [SMelly]
- Going around square/circle experiments [SMelly?]
- Maybe controller ? [SmellyNav]
